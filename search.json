    "text": "Description\nQuantitative methods in the social sciences are exploding. Each year researchers are deploying new and exciting methods to answer important substantive questions. But to use (and not misuse) these novel methods, it is crucial to have a firm understanding of the basic building blocks of quantitative methods in the social sciences: probability, statistical inference, and (more often than not) the linear model. This course, the first in the four-course quantitative methods sequence for PhD students in the Government department, provides this rigorous foundation necessary for the rest of the sequence and the rest of your careers. After reviewing the basic probability and statistical inference, we offer a systematic introduction to the linear model and its variants – the workhorse models for social scientists. We will cover the material with enough mathematical rigor to understand the intuition and concepts, but also cover how to use statistical computing to apply the methods."

Thus, in this course, you will have problem sets on a (roughly) weekly basis. They will be a mix of analytic problems, computer simulations, and data analysis.\nGiven the (waves hands generically at the world) situation, we understand that circumstances might make things difficult this semester. Accordingly, we will be dropping your lowest two problem set scores.\nProblem sets will be made available on Thursdays and be due the following Wednesdays. To see the full set of due dates, see the Schedule.\n\nLate policy\nThe late policy for problem sets will be a 10% percentage point penalty per 24 hour period late up to 48 hours. After that point, we will need to release solutions for the problem sets and will not be able to accept any more late work. No late work will be accepted for exams."

You can sign up for the Gov 2002 Ed page by clicking the Ed Discussion link on the sidebar of the Canvas page and you can join the Gov 2002 Slack here. To become more familiar with the platforms, please see the Ed users guide and the Slack quick start.\nWith two platforms, you might ask: where do I post what? In Gov 2002, Ed will be for help with and discussion of the content and materials of the course, whereas Slack will be for organization and community. Thus, questions and discussions about problem sets, reading, lectures, section, and so on would go on Ed. Slack would be better suited for meeting people, organizing study groups, seeing announcements about class, and various other logistical/social conversations.\nWhen discussing problem sets on Ed, please refrain from posting large portions of your solutions to a question. If, for some reason, you feel you need to post such a excerpt from your solutions to ask your question, you may make the question private (which means only the course staff can view it). Please use this sparingly, since more questions (and answers!) helps the whole group. In addition, please search before posting a question to see if someone else has already posted. Use the categories to help organize the discussions for others to read."

You may seek help from others so long as this does not result in someone else completing your work for you. When asking for help, you may show others your code to help diagnose a bug or highlight a potential issue, but you should not view their (working) code. You should cite any discussions you have with other students in your problem set and note if they helped you with your code. You should never copy and paste code from another student or elsewhere (e.g., websites, former students, AI tools).\nI also strongly suggest that you make a solo effort at all the problems before consulting others. The exams will be very difficult if you have no experience working on your own. There is no collaboration allowed on the exams.\n\nAI policy\nPlease do not use ChatGPT, GitHub Co-Pilot, or similar AI tools to help answer questions on problem sets or exams.

The Zero-Inflated Poisson distribution is a modification of the Poisson to address this issue, making it easier to handle frequent zero values gracefully.

    "text": "Question 3 (20 points)\nSuppose \\(X \\sim \\text{Pois}(\\lambda)\\), where \\(\\lambda\\) is fixed but unknown.\nAn estimator is a function of the data and the bias of an estimator, \\(f(X)\\), is defined as \\(E[f(X)] - \\theta\\), where \\(\\theta\\) is the estimand (an unknown quantity we would like to estimate from the observable data).\nFor instance our estimand could be \\(\\lambda\\), and we know by the properties of a Poisson random variable that the bias of the estimator, \\(f(X) = X\\), is \\(E[X] - \\lambda = \\lambda - \\lambda = 0\\). We call an estimator with \\(0\\) bias an unbiased estimator.\nFor this question, suppose that our estimand is \\(\\lambda^3\\) rather than \\(\\lambda\\).\n\nShow that \\(X^3\\) is not an unbiased estimator of \\(\\lambda^3\\) and specify the bias as a function of \\(\\lambda\\).\n\nHints:\n\nYou may use the following result: if \\(X \\sim \\text{Pois}(\\lambda)\\), then \\(E[X\\cdot g(X)] = \\lambda E[g(X + 1)]\\) for any function \\(g(\\cdot)\\).\nYou may use the result for \\(E[X^2]\\) derived in lecture and section, (i.e., no need to derive it again).\n\n\nSuppose \\(\\lambda = 5\\). Use \\(150,000\\) simulations to validate your result to part (a). That is, calculate the bias of you estimator from both the simulations and the analytical results. Print your results in the format below:\n\n\nset.seed(02138)\n\n# Simulation result \n\n# Analytical result"

    "text": "Question 4: Fisher’s method in forecasting (30 points)\nIn this problem, we’re going to explore a real-world example of Fisher’s “lady tasting tea” experiment from lecture: election forecasters – who have, for better or worse, become a big part of politics in the United States and elsewhere. Be sure to set your seed: set.seed(02138).\n\nSuppose that Bob has correctly predicted six of the last eight election outcomes. What is the probability that someone randomly flipping a coin each of the same elections would have experienced the same success as Bob? Use R to compute your answer analytically (i.e. not by simulation).\n\nForecasting has become so popular that riffraff are flooding the market. These “uniform amateurs” predict the vote share for each state in the U.S. presidential election by drawing a uniform random variable between 0 and 1, independently across states. You are deciding whether or not to hire a forecaster, Nate, to to forecast each of the 50 state election winners in the 2024 presidential general election based on the performance of his 2020 election forecast, but you are worried that Nate might be one of these amateurs. When you ask him to justify his 2020 forecasts, he says “my highest predicted [Democratic] vote share was 0.8 which is very unlikely if I were a uniform amateur.” Let’s evaluate his claim.\n\nSuppose Nate is a uniform amateur and let \\(X\\) be the maximum of the 51 uniform vote share draws (include D.C.). Derive the CDF and PDF of \\(X\\). Use these to calculate the probability of Nate’s highest Democratic vote share being 0.8 or less if he were a uniform amateur.\nTo be on the lookout for more uniform amateurs, it’s helpful to know what highest vote share we should expect. To that end, calculate \\(E[X]\\)."

    "text": "Problem set tips\nWhen completing a problem set, avoid writing a series of mathematical statements without prose. You should explain each step in any derivation so that both you and the grader can understand what you are doing. This is useful since (a) it helps reinforce the concept for your own understanding, (b) conveys to the grader (and eventually the world) that you understand the concepts that you are using, and (c) helps the grader debug any potential problems with the derivation to provide the highest quality feedback.\nWhen working with mathematical probability and statistics, success usually comes from pattern matching: this problem is isomorphic to some other problem that we’ve done before. Doing that pattern matching takes some experience, but it’s often help to try and strip a problem of its extraneous detail and focus on what the core elements are. Then, if you can’t see the path forward, try to find a problem that we (or the textbooks) have solved that has the same core elements."
