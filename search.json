    "text": "Description\nQuantitative methods in the social sciences are exploding. Each year researchers are deploying new and exciting methods to answer important substantive questions. But to use (and not misuse) these novel methods, it is crucial to have a firm understanding of the basic building blocks of quantitative methods in the social sciences: probability, statistical inference, and (more often than not) the linear model. This course, the first in the four-course quantitative methods sequence for PhD students in the Government department, provides this rigorous foundation necessary for the rest of the sequence and the rest of your careers. After reviewing the basic probability and statistical inference, we offer a systematic introduction to the linear model and its variants – the workhorse models for social scientists. We will cover the material with enough mathematical rigor to understand the intuition and concepts, but also cover how to use statistical computing to apply the methods."

Thus, in this course, you will have problem sets on a (roughly) weekly basis. They will be a mix of analytic problems, computer simulations, and data analysis.\nGiven the (waves hands generically at the world) situation, we understand that circumstances might make things difficult this semester. Accordingly, we will be dropping your lowest two problem set scores.\nProblem sets will be made available on Thursdays and be due the following Wednesdays. To see the full set of due dates, see the Schedule.\n\nLate policy\nThe late policy for problem sets will be a 10% percentage point penalty per 24 hour period late up to 48 hours. After that point, we will need to release solutions for the problem sets and will not be able to accept any more late work. No late work will be accepted for exams."

You can sign up for the Gov 2002 Ed page by clicking the Ed Discussion link on the sidebar of the Canvas page and you can join the Gov 2002 Slack here. To become more familiar with the platforms, please see the Ed users guide and the Slack quick start.\nWith two platforms, you might ask: where do I post what? In Gov 2002, Ed will be for help with and discussion of the content and materials of the course, whereas Slack will be for organization and community. Thus, questions and discussions about problem sets, reading, lectures, section, and so on would go on Ed. Slack would be better suited for meeting people, organizing study groups, seeing announcements about class, and various other logistical/social conversations.\nWhen discussing problem sets on Ed, please refrain from posting large portions of your solutions to a question. If, for some reason, you feel you need to post such a excerpt from your solutions to ask your question, you may make the question private (which means only the course staff can view it). Please use this sparingly, since more questions (and answers!) helps the whole group. In addition, please search before posting a question to see if someone else has already posted. Use the categories to help organize the discussions for others to read."

You may seek help from others so long as this does not result in someone else completing your work for you. When asking for help, you may show others your code to help diagnose a bug or highlight a potential issue, but you should not view their (working) code. You should cite any discussions you have with other students in your problem set and note if they helped you with your code. You should never copy and paste code from another student or elsewhere (e.g., websites, former students, AI tools).\nI also strongly suggest that you make a solo effort at all the problems before consulting others. The exams will be very difficult if you have no experience working on your own. There is no collaboration allowed on the exams.\n\nAI policy\nPlease do not use ChatGPT, GitHub Co-Pilot, or similar AI tools to help answer questions on problem sets or exams.

    "text": "Question 1 (30pt)\nThis problem will use the subprime data to walk you through a very common inference problem - testing whether the difference between two population values is non-zero. To begin this problem first download subprime.csv and load it into R.\n\nWe are going to be interested primarily in the loan.amount variable - the amount that each loan recipient received. Suppose a lawsuit has been filed in U.S. District Court by a group of Fort Myers women who claim that women in the area were loaned less money than men. The defendants – a group of local mortgage lenders – are vigorously denying these claims, and the case is now advancing to trial. Having heard about your expertise in this area, the federal judge hearing the case has brought you in to provide expert testimony. Your task in this problem is to assist the judge in her determination.\n\nSuppose you were only able to interview \\(100\\) male and \\(100\\) female loan recipients at random, making them iid. To simulate this in R, set the seed to 02138 and draw \\(100\\) observations randomly from the male subset of the subprime data and \\(100\\) observations randomly from the female subset of the data. These \\(200\\) observations constitute your sample. Calculate (1) the average loan amount (loan.amount) for women in your sample, (2) the average loan amount for men, and (3) and (4), the sample standard deviation for each.\n\n\n\nLet \\(\\mu_{m}\\) and \\(\\mu_{w}\\) be the population average loan amount for men and women respectively. Let \\(\\sigma^2_{m}\\) and \\(\\sigma^2_{w}\\) be the population variances in loan amount for men and women respectively. Denote the sample average loan amounts for men by \\(\\bar{X}_{m}\\) and for women by \\(\\bar{X}_{w}\\). What is the expected value of the sampling distribution of \\(\\bar{X}_{m} - \\bar{X}_{w}\\)? What is the variance of the sampling distribution of \\(\\bar{X}_{m} - \\bar{X}_{w}\\)?\nCompute and report your sample difference in average loan amount for men and women. Recall that for large samples, the sampling distribution of a mean or difference-in-means is approximately normal. Suppose that we know that the true population \\(\\sigma^2_{m} = 32381.57\\) and \\(\\sigma^2_{w} = 19097.95\\). Using the normal approximation, what is the probability that we would observe a difference-in-means at least as extreme as the one in our sample if the true population difference-in-means \\(\\mu_{m} - \\mu_{w}\\) equals 0? Note that by “at least as extreme,” we mean a value that is further away from \\(0\\) than the value we observe - that is, \\(P(|\\bar{X}_{m} - \\bar{X}_{w}| \\ge \\alpha)\\) where \\(\\alpha\\) is our observed value and \\(||\\) is the absolute value operator.\n\n\n\n\nComment on your result in (c). Given what we observe in our sample, is it likely that there is no difference in loan amounts for men and women? A common threshold for “rejecting” our assumed hypothesis that \\(\\mu_{m} - \\mu_{w} = 0\\) is observing a sample that would occur with probability \\(.05\\) or less if that hypothesis were true (that is, a very unlikely sample). Would we reject the hypothesis that there is no difference in average loan amounts between men and women?"

The Zero-Inflated Poisson distribution is a modification of the Poisson to address this issue, making it easier to handle frequent zero values gracefully. A Zero-Inflated Poisson r.v. \\(X\\) with parameters \\(p\\) and \\(\\lambda\\) can be generated as follows:\n\nFirst, flip a coin with probability of \\(p\\) of Heads.

    "text": "Problem set tips\nWhen completing a problem set, avoid writing a series of mathematical statements without prose. You should explain each step in any derivation so that both you and the grader can understand what you are doing. This is useful since (a) it helps reinforce the concept for your own understanding, (b) conveys to the grader (and eventually the world) that you understand the concepts that you are using, and (c) helps the grader debug any potential problems with the derivation to provide the highest quality feedback.\nWhen working with mathematical probability and statistics, success usually comes from pattern matching: this problem is isomorphic to some other problem that we’ve done before. Doing that pattern matching takes some experience, but it’s often help to try and strip a problem of its extraneous detail and focus on what the core elements are. Then, if you can’t see the path forward, try to find a problem that we (or the textbooks) have solved that has the same core elements."
